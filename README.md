# robust-regression-slope-test

Python code to implement OLS and robust linear regression and test for slope significance.

## Contents

* `robust-regression-slope-test.py` - python code that implements OLS and robust linear regression and tests for slope significance

The first step is to clone the latest robust-regression-slope-test code and step into the check out directory: 

    $ git clone https://github.com/patternizer/robust-regression-slope-test.git
    $ cd robust-regression-slope-test

### Using Standard Python

The code should run with the [standard CPython](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installation and was tested in a conda virtual environment running a 64-bit version of Python 3.8+.

planetary-boundaries-coxcomb scripts can be run from sources directly.

Run with:

    $ python robust-regression-slope-test.py
